# pyLLS
### a Python library for missing gene value imputation using local least square algorithm

The Local Least Square (LLS) algorithm is an algorithm that is particularly effective at imputing missing values.<br>
We developed pyLLS by implementing the LLS into python framework.<br>
Our pyLLS offers more options and is significantly faster than LLS in R.<br>
pyLLS is subjected to the MIT License, which guarantees free and commercial use for industry as well as the research community.<br>
